        <h2>📜 Cover Letter</h2>
        <p>
          I'm writing to you regarding the Internship role you are offering. I am a 4th-year Computer Information Systems undergraduate at the University of Georgia State and I am very interested in joining your company and helping it digitally transform.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am passionate about pursuing a career in Technology. I have completed coursework in databases, data analysis, system/business development, cyber security, project management, cloud computing, application development using Python and JavaScript, and extracurricular Python Django Full Stack Web Developer Boot Camp, Google Cloud Higher Education Summer Challenge Program, SDLC, and AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate courses that have provided me with the foundational knowledge for a Tech role. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I have also held several jobs that have helped my interpersonal skills and supported my ability to work with customers and as part of a team. My role as a Kumon tutor allowed me to practice and gain skills in uncovering the individual needs of students, determining their learning proficiencies, and providing positive in-class learning experiences. My role in Cutco exposed me to communicating and negotiating with customers to sell various products and understanding the need to build relationships with the customers to get them invested in the company's products and to act as product references. 
        </p>
<p>
  I feel these skills along with my aptitude for technology would allow me to quickly become a contributor on your team. Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.
